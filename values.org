* Values in Moxy
All values are immutable.

Simple types stolen from Racket:
- numbers
- strings
- functions

Compound types stolen from Racket:
- dictionaries (immutable hashes)
look at haskell's Data.Map for appropriate interface

Anns (tagged values), represented by a struct, consisting of
- tag: a tag (see below)
- args: an immutable vector of arguments (of length tag.arity)

Tags are not exposed directly in Moxy, but are represented as a struct containing:
- name: a symbol
- uid: a unique identifier (gensym)
- arity: natural number indicating constructor arity

# No lists
In particular, Moxy does *not* have racket-style lists.
(Of course, "let tag Cons(x,xs) tag Nil in ..." should fix this.
If this turns out to be a problem, can reverse this decision.
